											<li><strong>Fan Controller for A/V Closet</strong> 
												<p>Custom fan controller for an audio/video (A/V) closet. Thermistors are used to report back an ambient temperature and the microcontroller will control the fan operation. The fan speed varies based on the temperature by using PWM. A low-pass filter was used to smooth out the PWM signal to the fans to reduce audible noise. The fans are driven by BJTs.</p>

											<li><strong>HVAC Controller with Wood Burning Boiler</strong>
												<!-- <p>Background on the Need for this System </p> -->
												<p >This system was designed for use with an outdoor wood-burning boiler that was added to an existing HVAC system. Prior to the wood-burning boiler, the only heat source was from propane. With a propane/LNG system, some of the heat from burning propane is removed by something called a heat exchanger. The air from the house passes over/around this heat exchanger and the air is warmed and then returned to the house. An outdoor wood-burning boiler operates on a similar process. The heat from the burning wood warms a large reservoir of water. This heated water is pumped into the house and is routed through a different heat exchanger in the furnace. This heat exchanger was added after the initial HVAC system was installed.</p>
												
												<p>The request, or call, for heat comes from a thermostat when the temperature falls below a threshold. This heat signal from the thermostat is just that, a request for heat. The issue, if passed directly to the HVAC control system, is that both propane and the outdoor boiler heat would be used in this case. Obviously, the consumption of propane is wasteful when also using heat from the outdoor boiler. The original installer solved this issue by installing a manual switch that is used to toggle the use of propane when heat is called. This requires manual intervention if not utilizing the outdoor boiler, if the boiler runs out of fuel (wood), or if unknowingly extinguished for any reason. The unexpected drop in heat production from the boiler could cause issues if not constantly monitored.</p>
												
												<p>The solution to this was a separate controller that would monitor the incoming water temperature and determine how a heat call would be handled. When the outdoor boiler is being used, and heat is being requested by a thermostat, then the microcontroller would detect this and only request that the HVAC fan be turned on. As mentioned, the heat exchanger for the boiler always has heated water flowing through it and only needs air movement from the fan to heat the house. In the scenario where heat is requested and the incoming water temperature was too low, then a full heat call was sent to the HVAC to use propane heating. The new implementation was completely autonomous and required no intervention to switch between the 2 heat systems.</p>
												
												<p>The implementation of this microcontroller solution is simple when viewed alone, but the entirety of the HVAC system needed to be considered during the design. Redundancy was added where possible and a manual override was added if a total failure occurred. There were also issues from past HVAC modifications where the zone systems were disabled and could no longer be used. This was corrected as part of the design and the zones could once again be used with 2 thermostats.</p>

										<h2>Project List</h2>
										<ul class="alt">
											<li><strong>Power Meter</strong> 
												<p>As part of a school assignment, we were required to design a system that utilizes the Microchip PIC18 microcontroller. We worked in teams of 2 and had to deliver a working product by the end of the semester. My partner and I settled on creating a power meter for 120V AC measurement, similar to a “Kill A Watt” product.</p>
												<p>We utilized a PIC18F microcontroller, a hall-effect sensor for current measurement, an op-amp circuit for filtering and amplification, an LCD screen for display, buttons for user input, and step-down transformer circuits for power and voltage measurement. The PIC would sample both the current and voltage on regular intervals (via intterupts) and display that information on the LCD screen. Based on user input, the LCD screen would display power usage, line voltage, or current usage.</p>
												<p>By the end of the semester, we were able to deliver a working power meter that was as accurate (if not more accurate) than a purchased, low-end power meter.</p>
											</li>

											<li><strong>Stepper Motor Controller</strong>
												<!-- <p>Background on the Need for this System </p> -->
												<p >As another school project, we were asked to create a controller for a 5-wire stepper motor. We used a PIC18F452 microcontroller and a ULN2068b Darlington driver to drive the stepper motor. The user was able to control the direction and speed of the rotation via a potentiometer. The PIC would advance to the next step of the stepper motor rotation based on an interrupt with the timing of the interrupt determined by the user.</p>
												<p >The stepper motors that were given to us were lacking in documentation and produced rough operation based on the information supplied to us. Throughout this project, teams were getting stepper motor operation that was unreliable and “jerky”. These results were deemed acceptable by the lab instructor, but my partner and I believed that the (assumed) layout of the stepper motors was incorrect. After several hours of testing, we were able to prove our theory correct. We were able to determine that the assumed layout of the stepper motor was incorrect and determined the correct control strategy. The lab instructor told us that our stepper motor control was the smoothest operation he has seen in that lab.</p>
